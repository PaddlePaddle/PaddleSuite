| General Image Classification | Image Classification | [Online Experience](https://aistudio.baidu.com/community/app/100061/webUI) | Image classification is a technique that assigns images to predefined categories. It is widely used in object recognition, scene understanding, and automatic annotation. Image classification can identify various objects such as animals, plants, traffic signs, etc., and categorize them based on their features. By leveraging deep learning models, image classification can automatically extract image features and perform accurate classification. The General Image Classification Pipeline is designed to solve image classification tasks for given images. | Automatic classification and recognition of product images, real-time monitoring of unqualified products on production lines, personnel recognition in security surveillance |
| General Object Detection | Object Detection | [Online Experience](https://aistudio.baidu.com/community/app/70230/webUI) | Object detection aims to identify the categories and locations of multiple objects in images or videos by generating bounding boxes to mark these objects. Unlike simple image classification, object detection not only recognizes what objects are in the image, such as people, cars, and animals, but also accurately determines the specific location of each object, usually represented by a rectangular box. This technology is widely used in autonomous driving, surveillance systems, and smart photo albums, relying on deep learning models (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN) that efficiently extract features and perform real-time detection, significantly enhancing the computer's ability to understand image content. | Tracking moving objects in video surveillance, vehicle detection in autonomous driving, defect detection in industrial manufacturing, shelf product detection in retail |
| General Semantic Segmentation | Semantic Segmentation | [Online Experience](https://aistudio.baidu.com/community/app/100062/webUI?source=appCenter) | Semantic segmentation is a computer vision technique that assigns each pixel in an image to a specific category, enabling detailed understanding of image content. Semantic segmentation not only identifies the types of objects in the image but also classifies each pixel, allowing regions of the same category to be fully labeled. For example, in a street scene image, semantic segmentation can distinguish pedestrians, cars, sky, and roads pixel by pixel, forming a detailed label map. This technology is widely used in autonomous driving, medical image analysis, and human-computer interaction, often relying on deep learning models (e.g., FCN, U-Net) that use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract features and achieve high-precision pixel-level classification, providing a foundation for further intelligent analysis. | Analysis of satellite images in Geographic Information Systems, segmentation of obstacles and passable areas in robot vision, separation of foreground and background in film production |
| General Instance Segmentation | Instance Segmentation | [Online Experience](https://aistudio.baidu.com/community/app/100063/webUI) | Instance segmentation is a computer vision task that identifies object categories in images and distinguishes the pixels of different instances within the same category, enabling precise segmentation of each object. Instance segmentation can separately mark each car, person, or animal in an image, ensuring they are processed independently at the pixel level. For example, in a street scene image with multiple cars and pedestrians, instance segmentation can clearly separate the contours of each car and person, forming multiple independent region labels. This technology is widely used in autonomous driving, video surveillance, and robot vision, relying on deep learning models (e.g., Mask R-CNN) that use CNNs to achieve efficient pixel classification and instance differentiation, providing powerful support for understanding complex scenes. | Crowd counting in malls, counting crops or fruits in agricultural intelligence, selecting and segmenting specific objects in image editing |
| General OCR | Text Detection Text Recognition | [Online Experience](https://aistudio.baidu.com/community/app/91660/webUI?source=appMineRecent) | OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a technology that converts text in images into editable text. It is widely used in document digitization, information extraction, and data processing. OCR can recognize printed text, handwritten text, and even certain types of fonts and symbols. The General OCR Pipeline is designed to solve text recognition tasks, extracting text information from images and outputting it in text form. PP-OCRv4 is an end-to-end OCR serial system that achieves millisecond-level accurate prediction of text content on CPUs, reaching open-source SOTA in general scenarios.
